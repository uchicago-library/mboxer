* Does =mboxer summary= need to parse to pull date/from/etc. headers?
+ Yes.
+ If we grabbed that info out using a regexp, the regexp would be
  fooled by this situation, in which "Date: Thu, 14 Sep 2023 11:21:23
  -0500" and "From: Bugs Bunny <bugs@bunny.org>" are in the body of an
  email and are not functioning as headers:
  #+begin_example
    From: Daffy Duck <daffy@duck.org>
    Date: Wed, 13 Sep 2023 11:23:09 -0500

    From: Bugs Bunny <bugs@bunny.org>
    Date: Thu, 14 Sep 2023 11:21:23 -0500
